# Homework_2
Repository for the second week's homework.

3/9/20 Notes-

The page built so far is based on the layout of the different size pages that were shown in the assignment. The page focuses solely on the layout and responsive aspects of the site and neglects the content portions of the page to be filled in with time. The page right now still has bugs in the header area and some issues with alignment on the portfolito page. Due to time restrictions, this is my submission for the deadline. I will continue to improve the layout for smaller screens to match the assignment photos and will add content to match my portfolio.

I will also work to clean up the css code and comment both codes to make them easier to read and understand.
